### Assignment1
You will implement the following Haskell functions.
1. `subst :: Eq t => t -> t -> [t] -> [t]`

subst takes two values and a list, and replaces every occurrence of the first value with
the second in the list. 

For example:


`subst 0 1 [0,1,2,3]` should return `[1,1,2,3]`

`subst ’e’ ’o’ "dog"` should return `"dog"`

`subst ’e’ ’o’ "elephant"` should return `"olophant"`

2. `interleave :: [t] -> [t] -> [t]`

interleave takes two lists and returns the interleaving of the two arguments. That, the
result is a list in which the first, third, fifth . . . elements come fromt the first argument
and the second, fourth, sixth . . . come from second. If either argument is shorter than
the other, the excess elements of the longer comprise the end of the resulting list. 

For example:

`interleave [1,2,3,4] [11,12,13,14]` should return `[1,11,2,12,3,13,4,14]`

`interleave "" "dog"` should return `"dog"`

`interleave "wl" "arus"` should return `"walrus"`

`interleave "tlpone" "eeh"` should return `"telephone"`

3. `unroll :: Int -> [a] -> [a]`

unroll takes a list and an integer and constructs a list of the specified length made up
by “unrolling” the input list as many times as needed to construct a list of that length.
That is, the output consists of the input list repeated as many times as necessary to
have the specified length. 

For example:

`unroll 3 [1,2,3,4,5]` should return `[1,2,3]`

`unroll 8 [1,2,3]` should return `[1,2,3,1,2,3,1,2]`

`unroll 4 "ski"` should return `"skis"`
